        “ Life will time and again prove to you that in this big wide world, you are but alone. But not necessarily in a sad, lonely kinda way, rather in a way that if you surrender to, shall bring you immense peace. You will fall in love, you will have your heart broken, you will chase a dream, you will be disillusioned. And while you go through all these immensely beautiful experiences, there is no certainty of having someone to share them with. If you're lucky, you might find some people who'd like to accompany you for a while, maybe have a cup of tea or go for a 5-minute walk together, but beyond that, it's going to be you. You, going through life, trying to make sense of the world through a lens only you possess. At the end of the day, it's going to be you standing in front of the mirror with your bag of questions, answers, possibilities, dreams, losses, and everything you've collected over the brief span of time you've spent here. So try to have a great time with yourself, commit to understanding all you are and all you have the potential to be, and learn to be okay with others' misconceptions of you. They're on their journeys, you're on yours. Fill in your pocket with as many stories as you can, your heart with as much love as it can accommodate, and try out as many colors as you'd like on your canvas. If someone asks about them, don't hold yourself back, let them into your world and allow them to stay for however long

        they wish to. And if no one does, play your favorite song, turn the volume up, and bask in the glorious experience of being yourself, by yourse ”

        “ Despite having a supportive family, loving friends, and a clear life goal, I often find myself questioning why I'm still unhappy. Trying to improve my physical health and sleep cycle didn't guarantee happiness, and even in my happiest moments, I've still felt lonely and sad. On heavy nights, I let my emotions flow through tears, unable to understand what's causing them. In those moments, I try to remember to "flow with the flow," as my ideal once told m ”

        “ I understand that you have come to terms with the idea that having everything doesn't guarantee happiness, and that it's normal to feel empty sometimes. You've also come to accept that not every day will be a joyful one, even if everything seems to be going well. There are days when you may question your purpose, but during those times, you find solace in speaking with someone who appreciates your presence. On occasion, a simple song can bring you joy, while other days, even your most significant accomplishments fail to uplift your mood.. ”
